## Getting started

Planenote's tech consists of the *LAMP* stack for its MVC and *Node.js* + *socket.io* to drive its realtime chat. Planenote doesn't need the realtime chat stuff for it to function.

You can easily get planenote up and running in your local:

- Install LAMP (default configs are fine)
- Fork/clone this repo and place the files in **/var/www/pn**
- Build the database structure with the **db-structure.sql** file
- Navigate to the page in your browser, register a new account and login
